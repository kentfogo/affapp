# AffApp - Requirements & Success Criteria

## Project Overview
An affirmation app built with Flutter and Firebase that helps users hear personalized affirmations at intervals during movement sessions.

## Goals and Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- Users can create an account, complete onboarding questions, and pick 5–10 affirmations from a 400-item bank or add recorded ones.
- Session screen supports time and distance intervals; affirmation playback occurs at each interval; current affirmation displayed.
- Long-press stop ends session; a summary screen records the session and shows positive reinforcement; user returns to the start screen.

### How will users know this solved their problem?
By the end of their session, they have heard the type of affirmations that they needed to hear on repeat at the desired interval and it repeats in their brain.

### What does "working well" look like in real usage?
